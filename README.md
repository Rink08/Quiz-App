# Quiz-App
30daysofKotlin Google bootcamp

I have developed a Quiz Application using Kotlin. 
It has following kotlin features:
          1. listof -> to store questions,options/choice and correct answer
          2. shuffled() -> this method is used to randomly shuffle the questions whenever the app is launched/opened
          3. when statement -> if user selectes wrong option then using when the right option is turned Green 
          4. lateinit -> the keyword is used to late initialize the component at top of all functions but inside the class
          5. dataclass -> to hold value Intent constant
